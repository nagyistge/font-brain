# Font-Brain

### Goals

- parse a single brain map and extract header stuffs to get tags
- for all cases, be able to write back and forth between icons and NIDM results
- be able to parse a paper and produce likely tags (ask researcher about?)
- first is an interface (that could be added to neurovault) for user to select tags (and populate neurovault)
- mousing over a tag anywhere takes to some about page
- tags can be included in: manuscripts (figures text), personal content (blogs, twitter), NeuroVault, websites, etc.

### Steps
- Make list of tags to have (start with nipype functions)
- Make draft design icons
- Generate ttf file
- Convert to eof
- Develop css/style to give structure
- Make interface to tag OR try parsing papers!
