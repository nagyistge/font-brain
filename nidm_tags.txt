# Goals

parse a single brain map and extract header stuffs to get tags
for all cases, be able to write back and forth between icons and NIDM results
be able to parse a paper and produce likely tags (ask researcher about?)
first is an interface (that could be added to neurovault) for user to select tags (and populate neurovault)
mousing over a tag anywhere takes to some about page
tags can be included in: manuscripts (figures text), personal content (blogs, twitter), NeuroVault, websites, etc.

# Steps
- Make list of tags to have (start with NIDM result standards)
- Describe what icon will look like for each
- Generate ttf file with icons (draft first)
- Convert to eof
- Use font-awesome as an example to demonstrate use
- Make interface to tag OR try parsing papers...
